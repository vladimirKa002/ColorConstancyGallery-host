# Color Constancy Gallery

Welcome to a simple web-based game that explores a popular color constancy effect. In this atmospheric 3D environment, you will observe how the human mind benefits visual perception through examples of realistic objects illuminated by different lamps.

Enter the **[Color Constancy Gallery](https://vladimirka002.github.io/ColorConstancyGallery-host/)** from web-browser on your desktop machine! In this simple game-like experience you can vividly observe this interesting effect.

Use the following controls to navigate through the room:  
**WASD** - movement  
**Space** - jump  
**Mouse** - camera  
**LMB** - light switch

## Theory

Color constancy refers to the human visual system's ability to perceive the color of an object as relatively constant, despite changes in the color of the illuminating light. This phenomenon allows us to recognize the true color of an object, even when the ambient lighting conditions change.

For example, yellow bananas will appear yellow to us under both warm incandescent and cool daylight illumination. Color constancy is achieved through complex neural processing in the visual cortex, which compensates for the effects of varying illumination and extracts the intrinsic color properties of the object. This ability is crucial for stable color perception and object recognition in our dynamic visual environment.

## Approach

We experience color constancy continuously whenever we recognize the same object color under changing illumination conditions. However, it is not always easy to notice this effect because our brain performs the color processing automatically. To address this, the **[Color Constancy Gallery](https://vladimirka002.github.io/ColorConstancyGallery-host/)** provides a user-friendly interface with a color tracking mechanism that allows users to check and identify the current color in real-time. While the user perceives the object's color, a color bar will display the actual color being rendered on the screen.

For the experiment, six objects of different colors are present. Each object is illuminated by a lamp emitting a complementary color. While you will most likely perceive their colors as described, the actual color present to your eyes will appear **greyish**! Here is the list of objects and their corresponding illuminating lights:

| Object			| Light			|
| --------------    | -------------:|
| Green apples		| Pink			|
| Yellow bananas	| Blue			|
| Red strawberries	| Cyan			|
| Blueberries		| Yellow		|
| Cyan car			| Red			|
| Pink rose			| Green			|

## Example

Here is an example of yellow bananas under a blue light. You will most likely perceive the color as yellow, because your mind subtracts the blue illumination conditions from the image. However, the color bar in the top right shows that the actual color rendered on the screen is grey.
